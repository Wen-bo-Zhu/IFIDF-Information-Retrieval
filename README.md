# IFIDF-Information-Retrieval

This progam can be run through the terminal by the command: python ir.py, or by any existed python compiler.

After it processes the text and sentences, it will then calculate the IFIDF and cosine value based on the query structure of the vector. 

Then, it would produce a sorted output result on output.txt.

Thank you!
